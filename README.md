# Day 1: ML Fundamentals – NumPy & Pandas

Master the tools that power **99% of Machine Learning code** 🚀

---

## 📌 Overview

This project is **Day 1 of a Machine Learning learning path**. It focuses on building a **strong foundation** using:

* **NumPy** → numerical & matrix computations
* **Pandas** → real-world data handling

By the end of this script, you will understand how raw data is transformed into a format ready for Machine Learning models.

---

## 🎯 Learning Goals

After completing this lesson, you will be able to:

* Understand why **NumPy is essential for ML**
* Work with **1D & 2D arrays**
* Perform **vectorized and matrix operations**
* Use **Pandas DataFrames** to explore real datasets
* Clean messy data (missing values)
* Perform **feature engineering**
* Encode categorical variables
* Scale features for ML algorithms
* Split data into **features (X)** and **target (y)**

---

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

* Python 3.x
* NumPy
* Pandas
* Matplotlib
* Scikit-learn

---

## 📂 Script Structure

### 1️⃣ NumPy Basics – ML Math Engine

* Creating NumPy arrays
* Understanding shape & data types
* 2D arrays (matrices)
* Images as numerical arrays

### 2️⃣ NumPy Operations

* Vectorized operations (fast computation)
* Matrix multiplication (neural network core)
* Statistical operations (mean, std, min, max)

### 3️⃣ Pandas – Real World Data

* Creating DataFrames
* Exploring data using `.info()` and `.describe()`
* Selecting rows and columns
* Filtering data

### 4️⃣ Data Cleaning

* Detecting missing values
* Filling missing values using mean
* Dropping incomplete records

> ⚠️ Reality check: **80% of ML work is data cleaning**

### 5️⃣ Feature Engineering

* Creating new features
* One-hot encoding categorical variables

### 6️⃣ Mini ML Preprocessing Pipeline

* Simulated customer churn dataset
* Feature–target split (X & y)
* Feature scaling using `StandardScaler`

---

## 📊 Example ML Dataset

The script works with datasets such as:

* Customer demographics
* Income & purchase behavior
* Churn prediction target

This mirrors **real ML interview and industry workflows**.

---

## 🧠 Key Takeaways

* NumPy enables **fast numerical computation**
* Pandas is the backbone of **data preprocessing**
* Clean data is more important than complex models
* Feature engineering improves ML performance
* ML models only understand **numbers**
* Feature scaling is critical for many algorithms

---

## 🏠 Homework Challenge

Create a **House Price Prediction dataset** with:

* Size (sq ft)
* Bedrooms
* Age
* Location (urban / suburban / rural)
* Price (target)

### Tasks:

1. Generate 50 samples using NumPy
2. Load into a Pandas DataFrame
3. Check for missing values
4. Encode the location feature
5. Scale numeric features
6. Split into X (features) and y (price)

📌 *This is exactly what you will do in ML interviews.*

---

## ▶️ How to Run

```bash
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib scikit-learn
python day1_ml_fundamentals.py
```

---

## 🚀 What’s Next?

**Day 2:** Build your **first Machine Learning model** (Linear Regression)

Start thinking like an ML engineer:

> *“What patterns can a machine learn from this data?”*
